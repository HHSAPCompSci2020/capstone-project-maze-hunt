AP Computer Science Final Project - README Template


Instructions:
The first step in creating an excellent APCS final project is to write up a README. At this stage, this README file acts as your project proposal. Once you’ve filled in all components, Shelby will read through it and suggest edits. Ultimately, you need a document that adequately describes your project idea and we must agree on this plan.


Have one member of your group make a copy of this Google Doc. Then, they should share it with all other members so that every group member has edit permissions.


There’s a lot of parts of this document that you might not have full answers for yet. Because you haven’t written the program yet, it’s difficult to think about the instructions or which group members will do which parts. Even though this is hard to think about, you must have something in these sections that acts as your current plan. However, during the course of the project, you’ll continuously update this document. This means that you will not be held to exactly what you put here - components of this document can change (and it’s pretty common!).


There is one exception: the Features List section. Once Shelby OKs your README, the Features List section cannot be modified. For this reason, it is most important that you get a solid idea of what you want to make and the primary features it will have now.


Talk with your group. Consider drawing some pictures of what you think your project might look like. Be precise. When you’re ready, fill this out together. Each component in brackets below ( [these things] ) should be replaced with your ideas. Note that there are several sample READMEs posted on this assignment for you to use as guidance.

Maze Hunt
Authors: Anika Ummukulsum, Faith Dominique, Saloni Nadarajan
Revision: April 26, 2021





Introduction: 
Our program is a multiplayer scavenger hunt maze where you are given clues along the way as you progress through the maze. The clues tell you where the next clue is found and eventually once the proper number of clues are found, the exit of the maze is revealed. There are 2 players, a cat and a mouse and there are a number of tasks that hold clues to be completed. The mouse is trying to find and solve all the clues before getting eaten up by the cat and the cat wants to eat the mouse and not let the mouse finish the maze. We wrote this program because we really enjoy maze games and “who done it” scavengers and so we wanted to combine the 2 to make a scavenger hunt maze but with 2 players to interact and duel with each other. We also liked the idea of competition games between two players which is why we have a cat character whose goal is to chase down the mouse and try to kill it. The story of the game is that a mouse is in an abandoned maze and they don’t know how they got there. The cat doesn’t like visitors in their maze and so they want to try and kill the mouse out of anger. The mouse wants to get out of the maze as soon as possible since before getting bitten by the cat and dying.The rules of the game is that the player needs to go in order of the clues and cannot skip clues to their convenience since the next clue only gets revealed on the maze once the last clue has been solved. The ultimate goal of the game is for the mouse to find and solve all of the clues so that the exit of the maze is revealed and so that the mouse can exit the maze safely and go back home. 


People who would want to use our program are those that like to problem solve and challenge themselves through different riddles and/or puzzles. Our game presents challenging clues that get harder with each clue as the player progresses through. The primary features of our game are that there are hidden clues on the maze that need to be solved throughout the maze, the player (mouse) can pick up “diamonds” along the way that can be used later on to slow down the cat when trying to solve a clue or navigate through the maze to prevent themselves from being eaten up. The player (mouse) can also pick up super boosts that they find on the maze that makes them speed up and go faster so that they can run away faster from the cat. More features include pop up windows to solve the clues and also integrating the clus into the actual maze and not just having obvious circles on the grid.




Instructions: 
The cat will be controlled using the WASD keys on the keyboard and the mouse will be controlled using the arrow keys on the same keyboard. Places you will need to click include the startup menu to start the game, a clue on the maze to start solving the clue, buttons that will appear on the pop up windows to allow the player to progress or choose different actions against the cat, and diamonds that are present on the maze for the mouse to slow down the cat. In the beginning of the game a startup window will appear asking players welcoming players to the game and then they will be directed to choose which character they want to be. There will also be a help button that leads to the window of how to play the game and the different rules.Once the players have chosen their characters, they will then press a button to start the game. Once the player starts the game, the players will start navigating through the maze. Once the mouse arrives at a clue another pop up window will appear directing the mouse to solve whatever riddle or puzzle that it has and then the clue for where the next clue is will be revealed and displayed. Once the mouse has figured out and solved all the clues, the exit of the maze will open, otherwise the exit of the maze is always closed and players do not know where it is. Actions do need to be taken in certain order in the sense that players need to first enter through the welcome screen and then choose characters, then enter the game to start playing, and the mouse has to solve the clues in order.




Features List (THE ONLY SECTION THAT CANNOT CHANGE LATER):
Must-have Features:
[These are features that we agree you will definitely have by the project due date. A good final project would have all of these completed. At least 5 are required. Each feature should be fully described (at least a few full sentences for each)]
* The biggest main feature of the game is that this game is a multiplayer game and so 2 people can play at one given time against each other using different parts of the keyboard to control their characters. 
* Everytime the mouse picks up a super boost, the mouse’s speed will increase. For example, if the mouse’s initial speed is around 15 pixels per second, when the mouse picks up a super boost, the mouse’s speed will be increased to around 25 pixels per second.
* When the mouse arrives at the next clue, a pop up window will appear that prompts the mouse to either solve a riddle or puzzle related to the maze that will reveal where the next clue is located. In the pop up window the mouse will have to solve puzzles/riddles that are related to the maze in order for the location of the next clue to be revealed.
* Everytime the mouse picks up a diamond, the cat’s speed decreases. For example if the cat is traveling at around 10 pixels/sec, when the mouse picks up a diamond and decides to activate it the cat’s speed will be reduced to 5 pixels/second for around 15-30 seconds. The mouse can choose how long the cat will be at the speed with the minimum time being 5 seconds and the maximum time being 35 seconds.
* The clues will be integrated to be part of the actual maze and not random circles lying around. When the player solves the riddle/puzzle that reveals the where the next clue is, the next clue will be lit up/change color on the maze to show where the player should go. The exit will also not be revealed until the very last clue is found, once the last clue is solved the exit will actually be opened and once the player exits the game a end game pop up screen will appear summarizing the player’s journey throughout the maze and their achievements.


Want-to-have Features:
[These are features that you would like to have by the project due date, but you’re unsure whether you’ll hit all of them. A good final project would have perhaps half of these completed. At least 5 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
* Have players be able to type in answers to riddles/puzzles for the clues instead of just pressing buttons. Having a text box where players will enter text in the beginning of the game where they can enter their names.
* Allow players to choose from multiple different characters instead of just either a mouse or cat. Have a scroll down menu in the start that allows them to pick.
* Allow players to interact with items in the maze. If there’s a box, players can select a number button on their keyboard to open it. Being able to have players interact with objects, allows the game to be more fun when looking for clues. 
* Sounds that are played when different items are picked up, actions taken, and achievements unlocked
* Treasure chest that the mouse unlocks when they complete so many clues in a certain amount of time, the treasure chest will allow the mouse to choose either superboosts or diamonds as a reward.
* Different layout/maps/location from which the player can choose. There will be a different window that pops up when the player clicks on location. This window will have all the different locations that are available, from which the player can choose their preferred location.
Stretch Features:
[These are features that we agree a fully complete version of this program would have, but that you probably will not have time to implement. A good final project does not necessarily need to have any of these completed at all. At least 3 are required. Again, fully describe each.]
* Have different levels of the game where with each level the maze gets more and more complex and the number of clues and level of easiness of the clues increase. This could be something that the player can choose in the beginning of the game (choose the level they want to play) or something that occurs after the mouse successfully exits the maze( player will progress to next level) 
* Have a leaderboard where the fastest times that maze was completed is displayed.
* Have a chat box where the player can chat with the other player during the game. 




Class List:
[This section lists the Java classes that make up the program and very briefly describes what each represents. It’s totally fine to put this section in list format and not to use full sentences.]
* Startup Window class, the beginning window of the game
   * Game title, play button, help button
* Help Class, where the instructions for the game and rules are located
* Maze class, where the maze is to be constructed and built
* Player 1 class(mouse), where player 1’s entirety will be coded ranging from the construction of the player based on what the user picks in the beginning, to the player's movements, to its actions.
* Player 2 class(cat), where player 2’s entirety will be coded ranging from the construction of the player based on what the user picks in the beginning , to the player's movements, to its actions.
* Superboost class, where the speed of the mouse is altered depending on when the superboost is activated. 
* Sounds class, where different sounds are played for different actions made by the players
* Diamond class, where the speed of the cat is altered depending on when the diamond is activated against the cat
* Clues class, this class will be the superclass and have multiple subclasses to represent the different clues that will be displayed on the screen and their respective puzzle/riddle that they need to solve before the answer to the clue is revealed
* End screen class, where the end of the game card is displayed and shows either the mouse’s journey and achievements or shows the mouse’s death due to the cat.
